    Generates a square numpy array and populates it with location instances
    with capacity values set.
    Args:
        size: The number of rows and columns in the grid. If smoothing is not
        performed, complexity of grid initialization is O(size^2). However,
        if smoothing is performed, complexity increases much more rapidly
        with size, and large grids may take a very long time to initialize.
        smooth: Either False, indicating that no smoothing is to be
        performed, or an integer specifying the number of smoothing
        iterations to be performed.
        prune: Either False, indicating that no smoothing is to be performed,
        or an integer specifying the the capacity threshold below which nodes
        will be removed. Pruning is applied after smoothing.
        location: The class to populate the nodes with. Must be Location or a
        class inheriting from location, and must implement get_capacity and
        set_capacity methods.
        dist_fx: The function to use to determine whether or not a grid
        location will be populated with a location instance. Must take grid
        row index and column index as arguments, and return True or False.
        If None, then all grid coordinates are populated with location
        instances.
        capacity_fx: The function to use to determine what the initial
        capacity of a location on the grid will be (prior to smoothing). Must
        take grid row index and column index as arguments, and return an
        integer greater than zero. If None, then a simple power law
        distribution independent of row and column index will be applied,
        with an alpha of 5/2, to allow for a finite theoretical mean and
        variance.
        show_grid: Whether or not to show location capacity as a heat map
        after grid initialization.
        show_grid_log_scale: Whether or not to transform capacity with a
        logarithmic function before displaying it on the heatmap. If a power
        law or similar distribution is used to generate location capacity,
        this may produce better results.
        save_grid: Whether or not to save the heatmap. If False, the heat map
        is not saved. If a string, then that string is used as the
        destination to save the file to.
        show_plot: Whether or not to display a rank-frequency distribution of
        location capacities after grid initialization.
        show_plot_log_scale_x: Whether or not to apply a log scale to the
        x-axis of the rank-frequency plot.
        save_plot: Whether or not to save the rank-frequency plot. If False,
        the figure is not saved. If a string, then that string is used as the
        destination to save the file to.
        return_stats: Whether or not to return summary statistics (mean and
        standard deviation) of location magnitudes along with a sorted list
        of magnitudes.

    Returns:
        If return_stats is False, returns only the initialized grid.
        If return_stats is True, returns the initialized grid, mean capacity,
        capacity standard deviation, and a sorted list of capacities.
