# Empirical Motivations

Changes to personal mobility patterns rising out of the pandemic have been extensively documented,\cite{chang2021mobility} and agent-based modeling of housing mobility is not new. \cite{jordan2012agent} \cite{gulden2011modeling} Our work differs from prior approaches in two key respects: (1) while most work on mobility focuses on movement within specific cities, we take a more generalized and macroscopic view, incorporating moves between idealized cities, rural, and suburban areas, and  (2) we consider the impact of COVID-19 specifically on mobility dynamics. Our model was developed to simulate some of the drivers of household mobility identified by the research, which has shown that household moves in the United States are governed by two principal causes: 1) job opportunity and 2) improved living accommodations (taking into account factors such as cost, location, and quality).  It also incorporates other real-world behavioral phenomena, such as the relative frequency and distance of household moves as distributed across varying income levels.
