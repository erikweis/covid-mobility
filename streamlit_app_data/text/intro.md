# Introduction

The crisis presented by COVID-19, and the sweeping public health measures required to slow its spread, have necessitated widespread changes to human behavior across the United States. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has seemingly induced a widespread reshuffling of where people choose to live \citep{wu2021americans}. This reshuffling has been driven largely by the dramatic shift in lifestyle due to social distancing measures and remote work. Amidst this upheaval, housing prices also soared, to varying degrees, throughout the United States \cite{anenberg2021housing}. 

We want to understand the nature of this dramatic shift. In particular, how does an increased opportunity for remote work and increased desire for suburban and rural housing accommodation impact the demographics of communities in the United States? Our research team implemented an agent-based model of household mobility patterns prior and subsequent to the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic in an effort to simulate the impact on both intercommunity and household-level mobility dynamics, as well as community-level socioeconomic heterogeneity, of COVID-motivated changes to household income, preferences for low population-density communities, and the ability to work from home. Our model simulates the key mechanisms of these mobility shifts and explores the long-term impacts of the move on the demographics of communities.
